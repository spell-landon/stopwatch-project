# Stopwatch

## Project Description

This is a simple stopwatch project. I did this to get a better understanding of the `Date()` and `.getTime()` functions within JavaScript. I ended finding an example that used the `clearInterval` and `setInterval` methods which was a nice surprise so I ended up trying that instead. I added styling through css.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (get/set Interval)
